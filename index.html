			<p>Welcome to Burkes takeaway! We are a team of pizza enthusiasts who are passionate about creating delicious, authentic pizzas using only the freshest ingredients.

                Our journey began in the heart of Mayo, where we noticed a gap in the market for high-quality, authentic pizzas. We set out to create a menu that would satisfy the cravings of pizza lovers across the city, and we have been doing just that ever since.
                
                At our takeaway, we pride ourselves on using only the finest ingredients. Our pizza bases are made from scratch daily, using flour sourced from local Irish mills. We also use only the freshest vegetables and meats, sourced from trusted suppliers who share our commitment to quality.
                
                In addition to our classic pizzas, we offer a range of creative toppings inspired by Irish cuisine. Our "Meat Lovers" pizza, for example, is topped with locally-sourced bacon, crumbled italian sausage, and pepperoni.
                
                We believe that great pizza should be enjoyed by everyone, which is why our vegetarian option is topped with a variety of fresh vegetables and herbs.
                
                At Burkes takeaway, we are committed to providing our customers with a high-quality dining experience. Whether you're stopping by for a quick lunch or ordering in for a cosy night in, we promise to deliver delicious, authentic pizzas every time.

		<p>
			Jack De Burca has always loved pizza. As a kid, he would make his own pizza at home with his mom, experimenting with different toppings and sauces. When he grew up, Jack decided he wanted to turn his passion for pizza into a business.

            He started out by making pizzas for friends and family, taking their feedback to refine his recipes. He spent hours researching the best ingredients and techniques, determined to create pizzas that were truly special.

            After months of preparation, Jack finally opened his own pizza place in his hometown. He called it "Burkes Takeaway" and he was nervous but excited to see how it would be received.

			At first, things were slow. Jack didn't have a lot of money to advertise, so he relied on word of mouth to attract customers. But slowly, people started to take notice of his pizzas. They loved the crispy crust, the tangy sauce, and the fresh toppings.

			Jack's customers would rave about his pizzas to their friends and family, and soon, Burke's Takeaway was the talk of the town.

            As business picked up, Jack began to experiment with new pizza combinations, drawing inspiration from his customers' favorite flavors. He also hired a small team to help him with the growing demand.

			Jack's staff shared his passion for pizza and were trained to make every pizza to perfection. The team would work late into the night to ensure that every pizza was made with the same care and attention to detail.

            Years went by, and Burkes Takeaway became a staple in the community. People would come from all over town just to get a taste of Jack's signature pizzas. 

			Burkes Takeaway continued to grow and expand, with multiple locations popping up throughout the region. Jack was thrilled to see his dream come to life, and he was grateful for the support of his loyal customers. 

			Over the years, Jack has faced his share of challenges, from rising food costs to unexpected setbacks like the COVID-19 pandemic. But he never let these obstacles deter him from his mission to create the best pizza possible.

			He continued to innovate and experiment with new flavors, always striving to create the best possible pizza. And through it all, Jack remained committed to his customers, his staff, and his community.
			
			He made sure to give back to the community by donating pizzas to local charities and hosting events for families in need. Jack never forgot his roots, and he remained as dedicated to his craft as ever. To this day, Burkes Takeaway is known for its delicious pies, friendly staff, and commitment to quality, and Jack couldn't be prouder of what he has accomplished.
